Django uWSGI service controller. Handles the start, stop, reload and restarting of a given Django 
application. 

For more information on uWSGI, see http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/

Use the wsgi python file to run the wsgi-compliant application. The default file is [appname]/django_wsgi.py.
Starts the uWSGI command using unix sockets named by the app name. The pid file and socket are stored
in the temp workspace.

Use the 'reload' argument to restart gracefully. Requires uWSGI 0.9.5.
